      <h2>For test case authors</h2>
      <p>
        This project uses Gherkin files to specify test cases.
        Test case authors are requested to specify which application state has to be reached after a certain set of events.
      </p>

      <h3 id="structure">Structure of Gherkin files</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <span class="gherkin">Given</span> statement in Gherkin indicates the project to run.
          It is the only valid <span class="gherkin">Given</span> statement.
          This also implies that <span class="gherkin">Background</span> statements are unsupported,
          because they use two <span class="gherkin">Given</span> statements (one in <span class="gherkin">Background</span>,
          one in the <span class="gherkin">Scenario</span>).
          <pre>Given loaded project #30552428</pre>
          where 30552428 stands for an arbitrary project ID.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <span class="gherkin">When</span> statement in Gherkin specifies the block <a href="#matching">expected to be executed</a>.
          Consider, for example, a <a href="http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Go_to_X:_%28%29_Y:_%28%29_%28block%29">Go To XY</a> block.
          This block is represented as <code>go to x:{} y:{}</code> in the Scratch Editor where the curly brackets stand for numeric values.
          Equivalently to expect this block to be executed, you write a <span class="gherkin">When</span> statement with the same representation:
          <pre>When go to x:100 y:150</pre>
          There are also some <a href="#special_when">special <span class="gherkin">When</span> statement structures</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="gherkin">Then</span> statements are rather specific and do not conform to any consistent concept.
          Valid <span class="gherkin">Then</span> statements are listed below in section <a href="then"><span class="gherkin">Then</span> statements</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="gherkin">When</span> and <span class="gherkin">Then</span> statements can be extended using the <span class="gherkin">And</span> keyword.
          <pre>    When using Bat2
     And when green flag clicked
     And show
    Then costume bat2-a of sprite Bat2 is visible</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Example Gherkin files are provided in <span class="path">test/features</span>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="matching">Fuzzy block matching</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="gherkin">When</span> statements (extended by <span class="gherkin">And</span> statements) provide an ordered list of blocks with its parameters to be executed.
        Fuzzy block matching now uses this list and matches it with the blocks actually executed by some Scratch Player.
        For example consider the sequence {A, B, C} (where A, B and C are placeholders for block names) to be executed by some Scratch Player.
        A sequence {A, B, C} of block names specified in the Gherkin <span class="gherkin">When</span> statements matches this executed sequence.
        Fuzzy refers to the property that matching also happens for omitted elements. Besides {A, B, C}, the following sequences also match:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Executed block sequence</th>
              <th><span class="gherkin">When</span> statements block sequence</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td rowspan="5">{A, B, C}</td><td>{A, B, C, D}</td></tr>
            <tr><td>{A, B, D, C}</td></tr>
            <tr><td>{A, B, D, C}</td></tr>
            <tr><td>{A, D, B, C}</td></tr>
            <tr><td>{D, A, B, E, C}</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

      </figure>

      <p>
        Formally an executed block sequence <var>A</var> matches a <span class="gherkin">When</span> statement sequence <var>B</var> if and only if
        all elements of <var>A</var> occur in <var>B</var> in the given order of <var>A</var>. It is also important to point out that the matching is satisfied
        only all elements occured. The remaining elements in <var>B</var> do not have to be read.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>using {Sprite}</code> where {Sprite} stands for any name of a sprite.
          This statement builds Sprite context. All following blocks are referring to the given sprite (as in <code>when <em>this sprite</em> clicked</code>)
          unless the context is rewritten with another <code>using</code> statement.
        </li>
      </ul>
